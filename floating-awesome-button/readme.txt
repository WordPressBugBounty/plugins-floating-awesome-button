== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Floating Awesome Button (FAB) and why should I use it? =

A Floating Awesome Button (FAB) is like having a friendly, always-visible helper on your website that visitors can click anytime. Think of it as a smart button that stays in view while people browse your pages, making it super easy for them to take important actions.

This plugin comes with over 50 ready-to-use website features that help turn visitors into customers. You can add things like:
- Eye-catching buttons that follow as people scroll
- Attractive pop-up messages that appear at just the right time
- Quick notification messages that slide into view
- And many more engaging elements that get people's attention

The best part? These features are exactly what today's website visitors expect and love to use. Whether you want people to contact you, sign up for newsletters, follow your social media, or take any other action - FAB makes it simple and natural for them to do so. Website owners who use FAB often see more people engaging with their content and taking desired actions, which means better results for their business.

= What‚Äôs the difference between floating action buttons or other conversion buttons? =

With FAB, you get smart control over where and how your buttons appear. You can create targeted buttons that only show on specific pages using "location rules", customize visibility for mobile and desktop users, style buttons with your own icons and colors, add social sharing options, set buttons to appear during business hours, and much more.

The real magic happens with FAB's group button feature - one main button can expand to reveal multiple action buttons customized for that specific page.

FAB makes your website more interactive and engaging, encouraging visitors to take action in ways that feel natural and intuitive. The result? A more dynamic website that drives better results.

= Does FAB work on mobile? =

Yes, FAB works on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets. The button will be displayed on the right side of the screen, regardless of the device type.

= Usage Tracking (What Is Tracked & Why) = 

Are you curious about usage tracking in Floating Awesome Button (FAB)? Usage tracking helps our team to better understand our users and their website needs by looking at a range of variables in their FAB plugins, WordPress, and web host.

This information allows us to continuously improve our product as well as our QA/testing process. In this article, we've shared the details that FAB collects through usage tracking and why we track this information.

Below is the list of information that FAB collects as part of the usage tracking:

Floating Awesome Button
- Versions and activation status of FAB plugins ‚Äì So we know which versions of FAB are potentially responsible for issues when we get bug reports, allowing us to identify issues and release solutions much faster.
- License details & activation status (paid customers only) ‚Äì if you're a FAB customer, then we use this to determine if there's an issue with your specific license key, and to link the profile of your site with the configuration to allow us to determine if there's issues with your FAB configuration.
- FAB plugin settings ‚Äì Know which settings people are using allows us to determine potentially which new settings or areas of FAB people want us to expand on, and which settings people aren't using so we can make the interfaces more streamlined and usable.
- Usage tracking config ‚Äì The FAB option that contains the information on when the usage tracking data-sync will happen (once a week), so we can gauge the server load for the usage tracking servers.
- Effectiveness stats ‚Äì Anonymized statistical data relating to the effectiveness of button placement, popup engagement, and feature usage. This data is viewed in aggregate and not personally identifiable to your site.

WordPress
- Theme/Plugin names and versions ‚Äì So we know which themes and plugins to support and test against. FAB runs on thousands of websites. While we can't test with all 50,000+ plugins in the WordPress universe, we do our best to test against the top plugins and themes from this list.
- Site and user count and is multisite ‚Äì This allows us to gauge how important it is to support specific types of multisites like multi-network and similar styles of configuration and gauge how much we need to scale our servers before launching features. Knowing the sub-site count helps us ensure FAB scales properly for large networks.
- Locale ‚Äì We want FAB to be accessible to everyone, and knowing the site's locale helps us focus our translation efforts.
- Timezone ‚Äì We have users across the globe, so knowing the densities within various time zones helps us provide the best support coverage possible.
- Site URL ‚Äì The website address allows us to properly store usage tracking records so that we can avoid duplicated details.
- WordPress versions ‚Äì knowing which versions of WordPress our customers are using helps us better tune compatibility with differences in those particular versions. It also helps us identify gaps in our testing/QA processes.

Server
- PHP and MySQL Versions ‚Äì These details help us make sure our testing procedures have proper coverage to avoid compatibility issues.
- Server Software ‚Äì This reports if the web server software is Apache, Nginx, or similar, which is used for testing purposes.
